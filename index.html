  <h1>Personal Growth Dashboard</h1>
  <p class="subtitle">A living document for intentional growth — principles, practices, and progress.</p>

  <h2>Purpose</h2>
  <p>This is your knowledge base for becoming who you want to be. It's not a journal or a daily tracker — it's the <strong>framework</strong> you return to when you need clarity, direction, or grounding.</p>

  <p>Use it to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Anchor yourself in what matters most</li>
    <li>Track patterns and insights over time</li>
    <li>Build your personal toolkit for growth</li>
    <li>Hold both striving and acceptance in balance</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How to Use This</h2>
  <p><strong>Start with Principles.</strong> These are your core truths — the foundation everything else builds on.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Document in Growth Work.</strong> What you're actively working on right now — the edges where you're stretching.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Capture in Insights.</strong> When something clicks, write it down. This is how you build self-knowledge.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Build your toolkit in Practices.</strong> The mental models and methods that actually work for you.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Curate Resources.</strong> Books, articles, frameworks worth returning to.</p>

  <h2>Getting Started</h2>
  <p>This dashboard comes pre-populated with starting points, but <strong>make it yours</strong>. Edit, delete, reorganize. What matters is that it serves your growth, not someone else's idea of what growth should look like.</p>

  <p>Return to this weekly, monthly, or whenever you need to recalibrate. Let it evolve as you do.</p>
