  <h1>Insights</h1>
  <p class="subtitle">Realizations, lessons learned, and what's clicking.</p>

  <h2>Breakthroughs & Realizations</h2>
  <p>When something shifts — a new understanding, a pattern you finally see, a truth that lands differently.</p>
  <div class="placeholder">
    Date your entries. Write what clicked and why it matters.<br><br>
    Example:<br>
    <strong>Feb 2026:</strong> Realized that my avoidance at work isn't about the task being hard — it's about fear of not being good enough. The task is fine. The story I'm telling myself is the problem.
  </div>

  <h2>What I'm Learning</h2>
  <p>Ongoing lessons. Not conclusions — just what you're noticing.</p>
  <div class="placeholder">
    What patterns are emerging? What's becoming clearer? What are you still working to understand?
  </div>

  <h2>Decisions & What I Learned</h2>
  <p>Major decisions you've made and what you learned from them — good or bad.</p>
  <div class="placeholder">
    Not about judging past choices. About extracting wisdom.<br><br>
    What did you decide? Why? What happened? What would you do differently? What would you do the same?
  </div>

  <h2>Mistakes & What They Taught Me</h2>
  <p>Not a shame archive. A learning log. Failure is data, not identity.</p>
  <div class="placeholder">
    Example:<br>
    <strong>Avoided a difficult conversation with [person].</strong> It didn't go away — it got worse. Learned: Avoidance creates the outcome I'm trying to avoid. Facing it sooner is kinder to everyone, including me.
  </div>

  <h2>Patterns I'm Noticing</h2>
  <p>Recurring themes. What keeps showing up?</p>
  <div class="placeholder">
    Good patterns and destructive ones. Both matter. Name them.<br><br>
    • When I'm tired, I ruminate more.<br>
    • When I move my body, decisions get easier.<br>
    • When I avoid something, it drains more energy than just doing it.
