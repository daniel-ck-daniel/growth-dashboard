  <h1>Principles</h1>
  <p class="subtitle">Core truths that guide how I want to live and grow.</p>

  <div class="truth-list">
    
    <div class="truth">
      <div class="truth-title">You cannot think your way out of what you behaved your way into.</div>
      <div class="truth-description">Action precedes clarity. Rumination is a trap — small moves break the cycle. When stuck, do something. Anything. Movement creates momentum.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="truth">
      <div class="truth-title">Suffering = Pain × Resistance</div>
      <div class="truth-description">Pain is inevitable. Suffering comes from fighting what is. Acceptance doesn't mean giving up — it means working with reality, not against it. Stop the battle, start the work.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="truth">
      <div class="truth-title">Attention is your most valuable resource. Where it goes consistently, your life follows.</div>
      <div class="truth-description">What you focus on grows. Design your attention deliberately. Guard it fiercely. You are what you repeatedly notice.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="truth">
      <div class="truth-title">Small, consistent actions compound into identity.</div>
      <div class="truth-description">You don't need massive change. You need repeatable moves that prove who you're becoming. Identity is built one choice at a time.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="truth">
      <div class="truth-title">Growth happens at the edge of comfort, not beyond it.</div>
      <div class="truth-description">Stretch, don't break. Sustainable challenge beats heroic burnout. The goal is to expand your capacity, not destroy it.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="truth">
      <div class="truth-title">Connection is the antidote to almost everything.</div>
      <div class="truth-description">Isolation amplifies suffering. Vulnerability creates strength. When in doubt, reach out. You are not meant to do this alone.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="truth">
      <div class="truth-title">Build something. Create more than you consume.</div>
      <div class="truth-description">Meaning comes from contribution. Make, write, teach, help — leave things better than you found them. Creation is the cure for meaninglessness.</div>
    </div>

  <h2>Personal Values</h2>
  <div class="placeholder">
